## Code Usage

### (A) Python Environment

For this project we use [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) to manage dependencies. After installing miniconda, we can install the relcon environment with the following terminal commands:

    git clone https://github.com/maxxu05/pulseppg.git   
    cd pulseppg
    conda env create -f env.yml
    conda activate pulseppg
